Hi there — we’re Steph and Kyle. We’ve got two amazing girls, a shared love of travel, and very different creative outlets.

Steph is all about arts and crafts — give her a glue gun and a pile of fabric and she’s in her element. Kyle, on the other hand, can usually be found tinkering with gadgets, tools, or software that no one asked for.

This blog is our little corner of the internet. It’s a collection of thoughts, photos, projects, and memories — the kind of stuff most people probably don’t care about, but it needed to live somewhere. So… here it is.

We don’t update often (if at all), but if you’re here, thanks for stopping by.

❤️ Steph & Kyle
